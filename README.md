## About the models

 ### Gaussian Naive Bayes
 
Gaussian Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that assumes the features are normally distributed.For example, predicting the price of a house based on its features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.

In GNB, the mean and standard deviation of each feature are calculated separately for each class. This information is used to create a probability density function, which is used to calculate the probability of a feature belonging to a specific class.

### Multinomial Naive Bayes

Multinomial Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that is commonly used in scenarios where the features are discrete variables. For example, predicting the sentiment of a movie review based on the occurrence of specific words.

In MNB, the occurrence of each word in the document is counted separately for each class. This information is used to create a probability function, which is used to calculate the probability of a document belonging to a specific class.

### Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a variation of the Naive Bayes classifier that is particularly suited for binary or boolean features. It models the presence or absence of a feature rather than its count, making it effective for tasks like text classification where features may signify the presence of particular words.
